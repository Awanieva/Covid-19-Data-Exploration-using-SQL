# Covid19-Analysis

IS COVID 19 STILL A THING?
Well I carried out an analysis to determine that, and it turns out Covid 19 is not really a thing at the moment compared to 2020/2021.
This report shows analysis of Covid 19 data from January 2020 to September 2023.

**Tools** used: SQL and Tableau
I could sit with this Data for 2 months and still be deriving insights. However, I just pick a few important insight to display in the dashboard. I displayed more and detailed analysis in SQL report where I used lots of CTE’s and subquery to derive deeper insight. You can view the analysis done on SQL here Covid19-Analysis/Covid 19 Data Exploration.sql at main · Awanieva/Covid19-Analysis (github.com)

- Looking at the forecast from September 2033 to September 2024 it shows that will be a continuous decline in the covid 19 infection rate. (unless of course something else comes up).
- For Vaccinations 65% of the world’s population has taken full dose of the covid 19 dashboard. While 71% has taken at least 1 dose of  covid 19 vaccine.
